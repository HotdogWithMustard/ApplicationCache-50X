# ApplicationCache-50X

Installs an ApplicationCache.db that contains a modified version of [Al-Azif's exploit host](https://github.com/Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host) to your PS4, eliminating the need for a PC, smart device (Android/iPhone/Tablet/etc), or the ESP8266.  It also includes an option to make the browser never remember the last open page. (accessible via HTML payload)

**NOTES**

 - Clearing your Website Data in the browser will delete the cache.
 - Requires an internet connection to download ApplicationCache.db.
 - Uses sockets, so no SSL/TLS support. :/

If anyone knows how to get sceHttpInit working, let me know.
